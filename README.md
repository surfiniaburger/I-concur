1. Project Proposal:
### Title: Modern Charity Platform for Transparent Donations
*Overview*:
We propose the development of a modern Web2-based charity platform to address the lack of trust and transparency in traditional charity platforms. The platform will facilitate easy donations and provide real-time updates on the impact of contributions.

*Problem Statement*:
Traditional charity platforms often lack transparency, leading to a decline in trust among potential donors. Our platform aims to bridge this gap by leveraging modern technologies to provide donors with a transparent and user-friendly donation experience.

*Project Details*:
Timeline: The development process will span four months, divided into design, development, testing, and deployment phases.
